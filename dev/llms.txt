# applicable

## Introduction

There are times when a model’s prediction should be taken with some
skepticism. For example, if a new data point is substantially different
from the training set, its predicted value may be suspect. In chemistry,
it is not uncommon to create an “applicability domain” model that
measures the amount of potential extrapolation new samples have from the
training set. applicable contains different methods to measure how much
a new data point is an extrapolation from the original data (if at all).
